    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        I knew that having in mind the end user experience was important since they will be the ones using any application we might develop, however, I never though about all the topics mentioned.
        I know understand how important is to know how end users use their mobile devices and putting the buttons in the bottom part of the app can help them to use it quicker.
        Having in mind the speed of the connection and how many ways of reducing the size of the app we can find is really important.
