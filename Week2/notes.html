    <p>
        This activity helped us to know how we will be working in this semester as a group, helped us to start administrating our group in order to be efficient.
        This week we saw different types of declaring functions which I, honestly, didn't know about. Thanks to my group I understand how to do them and as a proof of that we delivered our team assignment
        since we are demonstrating not only our knowledge but also our ability to do the stretch assignments,too.
