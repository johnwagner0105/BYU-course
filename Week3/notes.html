    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        I didn't know anything about scss so, it was kind of an interesting week researching about it. I find it quiet interesting but still need more practice in this field.
        I also realized, more than before, that I struggle in designing since I have some difficulties to use the code to put the elements in order, por example using the display element.
