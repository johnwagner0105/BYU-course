    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        This week was really interesting we were able to do the tic tac toe but it was kind of hard since we all did it our own way. I prefered to do it with tables and my teammates decided to do it with divs.
        Fontunately we were able at least to make the tie rule for the divs but didn't do it for the table yet. When we saw the instructor's code we realized there wasn't the rules part, could you upload the code for that part so everyone can study it, please?
